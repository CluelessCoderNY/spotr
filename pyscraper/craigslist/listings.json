THIS RV HAS POWER JACKS THAT ARE CONTROLLED BESIDE THE DRIVER SIDE SEAT. THE A/C BLOWS EXTREMELY COLD AIR AND THE FURNACE DOES A GREAT JOB. THIS RV COMES EQUIPPED WITH AN ONAN GENERATOR AND CUMMINS DIESEL MOTOR. IT ONLY HAS 39000 MILES AND I WOULDN'T BE SCARED TO DRIVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN THIS NICE RIG. THE TIRES ARE 5 YEARS OLD BUT DON'T SHOW ANY WEAR OR CRACKS. THE AWNING IS A MANUAL AWNING THAT AS YOU CAN SEE IS IN GREAT SHAPE ALONG WITH THE EXTERIOR OF THE RV. THE STORAGE UNDER THIS RV IS AWESOME AND YOU WILL HAVE TROUBLE FINDING ENOUGH ITEMS TO FILL IT UP. IT HAS A 100 GALLON TANK FOR THE FUEL AND I HAVE ALWAYS GOTTEN AROUND 11-13 MILES PER GALLON WHETHER IN THE MOUNTAINS OR AT THE BEACH. WHEN I TOW A VEHICLE BEHIND THE RV THE MILEAGE DOESN'T CHANGE AND IT PULLS SO GOOD THAT YOU DON'T KNOW YOU HAVE ANYTHING BEHIND IT. ALL FLUIDS ARE CHANGED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND HAS NEVER USED ANY FLUIDS.    "
